# Ticket 03 â€“ VPN Setup Simulation

## Objective

Simulate a real-world scenario where a user requests secure remote access via VPN. The goal is to configure OpenVPN in a controlled environment while ensuring all prerequisites are validated before proceeding.

Before beginning, several pre-checks were performed to ensure a smooth setup and avoid common issues:

- VM network adapter set to **Bridged** mode and temporary VPN traffic allowed in Windows Firewall.  
- Verified that the VPN port intended for use is not blocked.  
- Generated fresh test certificates for secure authentication.  
- Double-checked user authentication information and exported `.ovpn` configuration file before testing.

## Next Steps

With the environment verified and pre-checks completed, the next step will be installing OpenVPN on the Windows 11 VM and importing the configuration file for testing.
