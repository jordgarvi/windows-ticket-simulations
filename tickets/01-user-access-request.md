# Ticket 01 â€“ User Access Request

## Objective
Simulate a real-world scenario where you're asked to create or modify a user account. The first step is to **verify the authenticity of the request**.

## Investigation & Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify the request
- Confirmed user request came from a verified HR contact.
- Request details were found in a simulated HR request file: `mock-request.txt`.

### Step 2: Open Local Users and Groups

- Opened `lusrmgr.msc` using the Run dialog.
- Navigated to **Users**.
- Verified that user `s.connor` did not exist â€” expected for a simulated environment.
- Proceeded to create the user manually using **New Userâ€¦** with a placeholder password and default options.
