# Windows Ticket Simulations

This project simulates Tier 1–2 IT support tickets inside a Windows 10 Enterprise environment. Each ticket is based on real-world scenarios that system admins and helpdesk technicians face daily.

The goal: to build practical troubleshooting skills and document realistic support workflows.

## 💡 Why I Built This

To sharpen my technical skills in a structured, hands-on lab environment. Each ticket is treated like a real job task, complete with planning, execution, resolution, and reflection.

This repo also serves as a growing portfolio to demonstrate how I approach problems, document my process, and build operational knowledge in Windows environments.
